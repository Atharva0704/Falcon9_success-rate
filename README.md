# ðŸš€ Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX has revolutionized the space industry by reusing the first stage of their rockets, significantly reducing the cost of launches. While a typical launch costs around $165 million, SpaceX offers launches at $62 million, thanks to this reusability. Predicting the landing success not only helps in assessing the cost of a launch but also provides valuable insights for companies looking to compete with SpaceX in the rocket launch market.

## Project Objectives

- **Business Problem Definition:** Formulate a real-world problem involving the prediction of Falcon 9 first stage landings.
- **Data Analysis:** Load, clean, and analyze datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- **API Integration:** Extract and manipulate data using APIs.
- **Data Manipulation:** Work with data in Pandas DataFrames and convert JSON data into a usable format.
- **Collaboration:** Share the project using a Jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Folium:** For interactive maps.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning models.
- **BeautifulSoup:** For web scraping and data extraction.
- **API Integration:** To extract real-time data from web services.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the entire project process.
- **GitHub:** For version control and project sharing.
